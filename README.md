### Vosk C Implementation üéôÔ∏è
-------------
This is a implementation in C using Vosk offline speech recognition lib for Windows

#### Requirements
- libvosk.dll and pthread dependences in windows. Download from https://github.com/alphacep/vosk-api/releases/tag/v0.3.427
- Get a voice model from https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models (https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models/vosk-model-small-es-0.3.zip for spanish lang)

#### How to use
You can run the Vosk_recognizer binary with next args

| Command argument| Description|
| ------------ | ------------ |
|`--mic` |To use the microphone|
|`--file <filename>.wav` |To read a .wav file|
|`--device-id <id>`  |To use a determinated device id|
|`--list-devices`| To view all available audio I/O devices|

#### About supported audio format
Vosk by default expect a wav file with a sample rate of 16kHz (16000Hz) an a bitsample of 16bit PCM. So the mic needs also to be switched to 16khz/16bit.
